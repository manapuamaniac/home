description: Prototype of our game that features audio cues at the start of the game and when walking through there are options to pick up items and use them for events like the tombstone. As we develop the game there will be more objectives to complete like walking through the lake to collect a certain item. As of now, our team have removed the switching mechanic as it felt out of place to have in the current setting along with the story of why that player has that ability. We have received many comments about our game that users like and disliked and will be further improved in the final game.
