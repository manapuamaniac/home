description: The final release of our game is here! It's titled Play With Me and the game concept where its set in a dense forest with beautiful scenery was instantly submerged by a sudden thick fog. There were screams in the fog, and It's like death is plundering every survivor's life. The player is lost in the foggy forest where he finds a unusual girl talking to him, once encountered the player runs deeper into the forest where he has to find clues about what's going on currently to piece together a story while also finding a way to escape the forest by collecting items and needs to avoid the crisis in the forest. It involves a examination system, inventory, etc. that allowed players to feel that they are actually in the forest. Beware when collecting these items as it may anger the girl and will take your life by force.
