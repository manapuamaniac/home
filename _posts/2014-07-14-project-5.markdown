description: As our group finishes up with the final release of the game it had updated even more to give the game a complete feel. It has a text dialogue where players can piece together a story with the given clues to find out whats happening in their current situation. Hands coming from the depths of the lake to try and bring you down with them. Certain monuments that guides the player where they should go. Overall, our team feels satisfied about our status of our game but there are improvements to be made. Play our game and see if it gives you a horror vibe and scare you out of your seat.
