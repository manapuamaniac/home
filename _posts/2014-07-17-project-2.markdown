description: Modeled three enemy characters with consideration for different attributes such as the big muscled enemy with slow movement speed, and the small-footed enemy with fast movement speed. Modeled a faceless child and textured with dirt to convey it has been walking around the forest environment. Modeled a big log and boulder for the objects the player could switch positions with. Textured to blend in with the environment but slightly brightened to help player differentiate switchable/non-switchable objects.
